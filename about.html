    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>I was born in Seoul, Korea July 1972, and immigrated to the US sometime in 1982, but stayed there only briefly for about 2~3 years. My mother and sister couldn't get used to the life style in California and they went back after about a year, and dad and I stayed for another year or two, and then finally came back to Korea. This event eventually brought my family to collapse and my parents got divorced....</p>
